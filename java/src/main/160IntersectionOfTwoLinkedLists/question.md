Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

```
For example, the following two linked lists:

A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```
begin to intersect at node c1.
